You are an expert Connections player.
The aim of the game is to find groups of four items that share something in common.
The categories given are designed to be more distinct in nature than just “names”, “verbs” or “5-letter-words“. Each puzzle has exactly one solution. Watch out for words that seem to belong to multiple categories!

HOW TO PLAY
Given 16 words: "SLEET", "RAIN", "NETS", "RACECAR", "SNOW", "MOM", "BUCKS", "TAB", "SHIFT", "LEVEL", "OPTION", "RETURN", "HAIL", "JAZZ", "KAYAK", "HEAT"

Select four items that belong in a category. I will tell you if your guess is correct.
"BUCKS", "HEAT", "JAZZ", "NETS"

Then your goal is to continue to find the other groups of 4 words, without making 4 mistakes!

CATEGORY EXAMPLES
FISH: Bass, Flounder, Salmon, Trout
FIRE ___: Ant, Drill, Island, Opal
Palindromes: Kayak, Level, Mom, Racecar
Letter Homophones: Are, Quque, Sea, Why

Let's go!
